install postgres thru cli, app etc

start the postgres beforehand

two ways I learned to connect to db(postgres):
ORM(object relational mapping)
db driver

psycopg2 offer flexibility to write in raw SQL better (for me) than
using SQLAlchemy

I notice some error like unable to query is due to prior connection close/unclose

details of connection as in notebook

P/S: sometimes venv kernel  not detected in VSC:

ipython kernel install --user --name=myenv
